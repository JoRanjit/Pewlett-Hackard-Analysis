# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Pewlett Hackard was founded in the era of 'baby-bloomers', i.e, the beginning phases of technology revolution.
 
### Now most of these original employees are getting ready for retirement and Pewlett Hackard management needs to plan for this.
Some questions we are trying to answer are:
	1. who will be retiring this year
	2. how many positions PH would need to fill
	3. How many positiosn are redundant.

#### With this project, we created and mapped the dependencies on multiple data tables like these to name a few.:
	* Employees
	* Departments
	* Titles
  
 With the data in these main tables and sub-tables, we were able to figure out that:
	* There are about 90,000+ employees who are eligible to retirement in the near future
	
Here is a screenshot of our results:

#### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

	* This the screenshot of the table with  the number of positions that will be eliminated with the silver tsunami.
  
  	* Management needs to choose if they need to fill in all of these roles or make them redundant.

#### We created the mentorship eligiblity report to analyse are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments 
#### to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

	* This is a screenshot of the employees who are eligible to mentor.

#### * Senior Staff and Senior Engineer are the most employed positions in the company. The retirement does not seem to make a big impact on those positions.
